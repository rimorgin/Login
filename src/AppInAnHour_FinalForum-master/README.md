# App in about an hour - Discussion Board Repo

In this repo you will find the code that was created whilst filming the App in about an hour episode on 
[The Reactionary.net youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgDwCRp7T311ItY0XCUhGA). Click
the link and you'll find the video on that channel.

To make this code work you'll need to clone down the repo, run an npm install and then you'll also need
to put your firebase configuration in the config object that is defined int he /src/App.js file.

If you have any questions or comments about the code please don't hesitate to contact me on any of my social
media which you can find at the top of the page at [thereactionary.net](http://thereactionary.net)
